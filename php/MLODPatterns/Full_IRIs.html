<h1>Full IRIs</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

<p>This patterns consists of using unrestricted IRIs 
 which can contain Unicode characters outside the ASCII repertoire.

<h2>Context</h2>
<p>In a multilingual setting, it is necessary to take into 
 account that human-readability is not a generic aspect, 
 but depends heavily on people’s culture and background. 
 URIs employing only ASCII characters are difficult to 
 handle by people used to non-Latin alphabets. 
 
<p>This pattern can solve that situation by allowing the 
 application to use Unicode characters in resource identifiers.  
 
<h2>Example</h2>

A full IRI using the Armenian language can be:

<pre>
<code>
http://օրինակ.օրգ#Հայաստան
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Discussion</h2>

<p>IRIs with Unicode characters are more natural for 
 people whose primary language is not Latin based. 
 Since machines should be able to identify resources 
 in either encoding and the technologies have already been 
 developed, a further step is to make resource identifiers 
 human friendly. 

<p> Although it is said that the end user should not be exposed 
 to URIs and that they should act as internal identifiers, 
 in practice, they are handled by application developers 
 and sometimes even by end users.

<p>Human friendly IRIs can facilitate the adoption of linked data 
 technologies by more people in the long term. 
  However, the use of IRIs may be exposed to visual spoofing attacks 
  given that glyphs with the same appearance may refer to different 
  characters.
  
<p>Another important issue is the lack of support of IRIs by 
 current software libraries. 
 Although the support is improving, nowadays it is still a 
 challenge and most of the tools only offer partial support.

<p>Unicode has published some security considerations for IRIs 
 which should be taken into account <a href="references.html#UTR36">[UTR 36]</a>. 
 A soft version of this pattern is 
 <a href="Internationalized_Local_names.html">Internationalized local names</a>. 

<p>According to <a href="references.html#Kontokostas12">[Kontokostas 12, section 6.1]</a>, 
 IRI dereferencing should be handled carefully as the 
 HTTP Protocol (<a href="http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616.html">RFC 2616</a>) can transfer only URIs.
