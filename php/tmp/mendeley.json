This is problematic because while simple approaches are assumed to be good enough, core problems are not addressed. Thus, this paper aims to (1) provide a balanced and critical review of the state of the art; (2) cast light on the presume predictive power of Twitter data; and (3) depict a roadmap to push forward the field. Hence, a scheme to characterize Twitter prediction methods is proposed. It covers every aspect from data collection to performance evaluation, through data processing and vote inference. Using that scheme, prior research is analyzed and organized to explain the main approaches taken up to date but also their weaknesses. This is the first meta-analysis of the whole body of research regarding electoral prediction from Twitter data. It reveals that its presumed predictive power regarding electoral prediction has been rather exaggerated: although social media may provide a glimpse on electoral outcomes current research does not provide strong evidence to support it can replace traditional polls. Finally, future lines of research along with a set of requirements they must fulfill are provided.",

There are few because search engine companies are reluctant to release such data; they are dated because they were collected in late 1990s or early 2000s; and they are small because they comprise data for at most one day and just a few hundreds of thousands of users. Even worse, the large query log disclosed by AOL in 2006 caused more harm than good because of a big privacy flaw. In this paper the author provides an overall view of the possible applications of query logs, the privacy concerns researchers must face when working on such datasets, and several ways in which query logs can be easily sanitized. One of such measures consists of segmenting the logs into short topical sessions. Therefore, the author offers a comprehensive survey of session detection methods, as well as a thorough description of a new evaluation framework with performance results for each of the different methods. Additionally, a new, simple, but outperforming session detection method is proposed. It is a heuristic-based technique which works on the basis of a geometric interpretation of both the time gap between queries and the similarity between them in order to flag a topic shift.",

Academically speaking, there is little doubt about the usefulness of demographic studies conducted on OSNs and, hence, methods to label unknown users from small labeled samples are very useful. However, from the general public point of view, this can be a serious privacy concern. Thus, both topics are tackled in this paper: First, a new algorithm to perform user profiling in social networks is described, and its performance is reported and discussed. Secondly, the experiments -conducted on information usually considered sensitive- reveal that by just publicizing one's contacts privacy is at risk and, thus, measures to minimize privacy leaks due to social graph data mining are outlined.",

Almost everybody -users, marketers, brands, companies, and researchers- is approaching OSNs to better understand them and take advantage of their benefits. Maybe one of the key concepts underlying OSNs is that of influence which is highly related, although not entirely identical, to those of popularity and centrality. Influence is, according to Merriam-Webster, \"the capacity of causing an effect in indirect or intangible ways\". Hence, in the context of OSNs, it has been proposed to analyze the clicks received by promoted URLs in order to check for any positive correlation between the number of visits and different \"influence\" scores. Such an evaluation methodology is used in this paper to compare a number of those techniques with a new method firstly described here. That new method is a simple and rather elegant solution which tackles with influence in OSNs by applying a physical metaphor.",

It was only a matter of time before the research community turned to it as a rich source of social, commercial, marketing, and political information.

One interesting aspect of this trend is the possibility of pulsing the publics opinion about the elections, and that has attracted the interest of many researchers and the press. Allegedly, predicting electoral outcomes from social media data can be feasible and even simple. Positive results have been reported, but without an analysis on what principle enables them. Our work puts to test the purported predictive power of socialmedia metrics against the 2010 US congressional elections. Here, we applied techniques that had reportedly led to positive election predictions in the past, on the Twitter data collected from the 2010 US congressional elections. Unfortunately, we find no correlation between the analysis results and the electoral outcomes, contradicting previous reports. Observing that 80 years of polling research would support our findings, we argue that one should not be accepting predictions about events using social media data as a black box. Instead, scholarly research should be accompanied by a model explaining the predictive power of social media, when there is one.",

However, sometimes they only categorize the text into a topic being more useful a summary. Keywords and abstracts are common in scientific and technical literature but most of the documents available (e.g., web pages) lack such help, so automatic keyword extraction and summarization tools are fundamental to fight against the information overload and improve the users experience. Therefore, this paper describes a new technique to obtain keyphrases and summaries from a single document. With this technique, inspired by the process of protein biosynthesis, a sort of document DNA can be extracted and translated into a significance protein which both produces a set of keyphrases and acts on the document highlighting the most relevant passages. These ideas have been implemented into a prototype, publicly available in the Web, which has obtained really promising results.",

Thus, such services can develop into valuable sources of up-to-date information (the so-called real-time web) provided a way to find the most users is available. Hence, this makes a highly pertinent question for which graph centrality methods can provide an answer. In this paper the author offers a comprehensive survey of feasible algorithms for ranking users in social networks, he examines their vulnerabilities to linking malpractice in such networks, and suggests an objective criterion against which to compare such algorithms. Additionally, he suggests a first step towards \"desensitizing\" prestige algorithms against cheating by spammers and other abusive users.",

Some of the students are very interested in computer programming but most of them find the subject quite hard. This situation is particularly stressed when concerning theoretical aspects and, in fact, many students view these areas as the main difficulty of the subject. Because of this, the authors decided to explore new ways to improve the student learning of theoretical concepts. Thus, they analyzed the use of online self-assessment tools as a self-learning system. To perform this analysis two different kinds of tools were chosen and the authors developed an experiment to evaluate, on one hand, the possible use of self-assessment tools as self-learning systems and, on the other hand, to compare the tools to each other.",

By providing more accurate results depending on such query intents the performance of search engines can be greatly improved. Therefore, query classification has been an active research topic for the last years. However, while query topic classification has deserved a specific bakeoff, no evaluation campaign has been devoted to the study of automatic query intent detection. In this paper some of the available query intent detection techniques are reviewed, an evaluation framework is proposed, and it is used to compare those methods in order to shed light on their relative performance and drawbacks. As it will be shown, manually prepared goldstandard files are much needed, and traditional pooling is not the most feasible evaluation method. In addition to this, future lines of work in both query intent detection and its evaluation are proposed.",

This platform requires a step-based method to deal with the requirements of the public procurement sector and the open government data initiative: (1) modeling the unstructured information included in public procurement notices (contracting authorities, organizations, contracts awarded, etc.); (2) enriching that information with the existing product classi\u00afcation systems and the linked data vocabularies; (3) publishing relevant information extracted out of the notices following the linking open data approach; (4) implementing enhanced services based on advanced algorithms and techniques like query expansion methods to exploit the information in a semantic way. Taking into account that public procurement notices contain different kind of data like types of contract, region, duration, totalamount, target enterprise, etc., various methods can be applied to expand user queries easing the access to the information and providing a more accurate information retrieval system. Nevertheless expanded user queries can involve an extra-time in the process of retrieving notices. That is why a performance evaluation is outlined to tune up the semantic methods and the generated queries providing a scalable and time-e\u00b1cient system. Moreover, this platform is supposed to be especially relevant for SMEs that want to tender in the European Union (EU), easing their access to the information of the notices and fostering their participation in crossborder public procurement processes across Europe. Finally an example of use is provided to evaluate and compare the goodness and the improvement of the proposed platform with regard to the existing ones.",
